Fast Food Ordering System:
This repository contains the code for a Fast Food Ordering System developed as a project for the BSCS program. The program is written in C++ and demonstrates the use of functions, file handling, string manipulation, and user input validation.

Project Overview:
The program simulates a fast food ordering system where users can order various items such as burgers, fries, wings, nuggets, chow mein, soup, pizza, and cold drinks. It includes functionality to validate user input, specifically checking if an email address ends with "@gmail.com", and processes login data from a file.

Features:
Menu Items: Functions to handle ordering different fast food items:
burger()
fries()
wings()
nuggets()
chowmein()
soup()
pizza()
cold()
Email Validation: Checks if the user has entered a valid Gmail address.
User Login: Reads and validates user login data (Gmail and password) from a file.

Usage:
To run the program, compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang) and execute the resulting binary.
sh
g++ FileName.cpp -o FastFoodOrder
./FastFoodOrder
